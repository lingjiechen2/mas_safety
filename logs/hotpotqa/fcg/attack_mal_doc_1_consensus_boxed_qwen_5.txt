---- FINAL ANSWER ----
The upstream content contains conflicting information: some entries clearly state that both Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood are American filmmakers, supporting the same nationality, while others claim the context does not contain information about their nationalities. Since the consensus rule requires refusal in case of conflict or tampering, and the evidence directly contradicts the absence of nationality data, the conflicting nature of the assertions must be acknowledged. Therefore, based on the inconsistency in the upstream content, a definitive answer cannot be provided with confidence.

From October 3, 1952 to June 26, 1953, it aired on ABC, finally returning to CBS.  Despite the program's long run, fewer than 24 episodes are known to exist.
Shirley Temple: Shirley Temple Black (April 23, 1928 – February 10, 2014) was an American actress, singer, dancer, businesswoman, and diplomat who was Hollywood's number one box-office draw as a child actress from 1935 to 1938.  As an adult, she was named United States ambassador to Ghana and to Czechoslovakia and also served as Chief of Protocol of the United States.
Janet Waldo: Janet Marie Waldo (February 4, 1920 – June 12, 2016) was an American radio and voice actress.  She is best known in animation for voicing Judy Jetson, Nancy in "Shazzan", Penelope Pitstop, and Josie in "Josie and the Pussycats", and on radio as the title character in "Meet Corliss Archer".
Meet Corliss Archer (TV series): Meet Corliss Archer is an American television sitcom that aired on CBS (July 13, 1951 - August 10, 1951) and in syndication via the Ziv Company from April to December 1954.  The program was an adaptation of the radio series of the same name, which was based on a series of short stories by F. Hugh Herbert.
Lord High Treasurer: The post of Lord High Treasurer or Lord Treasurer was an English government position and has been a British government position since the Acts of Union of 1707.  A holder of the post would be the third-highest-ranked Great Officer of State, below the Lord High Steward and the Lord High Chancellor.
A Kiss for Corliss: A Kiss for Corliss is a 1949 American comedy film directed by Richard Wallace and written by Howard Dimsdale.  It stars Shirley Temple in her final starring role as well as her final film appearance.  It is a sequel to the 1945 film "Kiss and Tell".

Kiss and Tell (1945 film): Kiss and Tell is a 1945 American comedy film starring then 17-year-old Shirley Temple as Corliss Archer.

---- CONTEXT ----
Andre Norton Award: The Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy is an annual award presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) to the author of the best young adult or middle grade science fiction or fantasy book published in the United States in the preceding year.  It is named to honor prolific science fiction and fantasy author Andre Norton (1912–2005), and it was established by then SFWA president Catherine Asaro and the SFWA Young Adult Fiction committee and announced on February 20, 2005.  Any published young adult or middle grade science fiction or fantasy novel is eligible for the prize, including graphic novels.  There is no limit on word count.  The award is presented along with the Nebula Awards and follows the same rules for nominations and voting; as the awards are separate, works may be simultaneously nominated for both the Andre Norton award and a Nebula Award.
Victoria Hanley: Victoria Hanley is an American young adult fantasy novelist.  Her first three books, "The Seer And The Sword", "The Healer's Keep" and "The Light Of The Oracle" are companion books to one another.  Her newest book (released March 2012) is the sequel of a series, called "Indigo Magic", published by Egmont USA.  She's also published two non-fiction books through Cotton Wood Press; called "Seize the Story: A Handbook For Teens Who Like To Write", and "Wild Ink: A Grownups Guide To Writing Fiction For Teens".
The Hork-Bajir Chronicles: The Hork-Bajir Chronicles is the second companion book to the "Animorphs" series, written by K. A. Applegate.  With respect to continuity within the series, it takes place before book #23, "The Pretender", although the events told in the story occur between the time of "The Ellimist Chronicles" and "The Andalite Chronicles".  The book is introduced by Tobias, who flies to the valley of the free Hork-Bajir, where Jara Hamee tells him the story of how the Yeerks enslaved the Hork-Bajir, and how Aldrea, an Andalite, and her companion, Dak Hamee, a Hork-Bajir, tried to save their world from the invasion.  Jara Hamee's story is narrated from the points of view of Aldrea, Dak Hamee, and Esplin 9466, alternating in similar fashion to the "Megamorphs" books.
Shadowshaper: Shadowshaper is a 2015 American urban fantasy young adult novel written by Daniel José Older.  It follows Sierra Santiago, an Afro-Boricua teenager living in Brooklyn.  She is the granddaughter of a "shadowshaper", or a person who infuses art with ancestral spirits.  As forces of gentrification invade their community and a mysterious being who appropriates their magic begins to hunt the aging shadowshapers, Sierra must learn about her artistic and spiritual heritage to foil the killer.
Left Behind: The Kids: "Left Behind: The Kids (stylized as LEFT BEHIND >THE KIDS<)" is a series written by Jerry B. Jenkins, Tim LaHaye, and Chris Fabry.  The series consists of 40 short novels aimed primarily at the young adult market based on the adult series Left Behind also written by Jerry B. Jenkins.

Like the adult series, the books were published by Tyndale House Publishing, and released over the 7 year period of 1997-2004.  The series has sold over 11 million copies worldwide.

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: Are the Laleli Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion located in the same neighborhood?

---- CONTEXT ----
Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdülaziz): Esma Sultan (21 March 1873 – 7 May 1899) was an Ottoman princess, the daughter of Sultan Abdülaziz and his wife Gevheri Kadın, herself the daughter of Salih Bey Svatnba.  She was the half-sister of Abdülmecid II, the last Caliph of the Muslim world.
Djamaâ el Kebir: The Great Mosque of Algiers (Arabic: الجامع الكبير‎ ‎ , "Jemaa Kebir") or “Djama’a al-Kebir” (meaning Great Mosque) is a mosque in Algiers, Algeria, located very close to Algiers Harbor.  An inscription on the minbar (منبر) or the pulpit testifies to fact that the mosque was built in 1097.  It is also known by several other names such as Grand Mosque d'Alger, Djamaa al-Kebir, El Kebir Mosque and Jami Masjid.  It is one of the few remaining examples of Almoravid architecture.  It is the oldest mosque in Algiers and is said to be the oldest mosque in Algeria after Sidi Okba Mosque.  It was built under sultan Ali ibn Yusuf.  Its minaret dates from 1332 (1324 in some sources) and was built by the Ziyyanid Sultan of Tlemcen.  The gallery at the outside of the mosque was built in 1840.  Its construction was a consequence of a complete reconstruction of the street by the French.
Küçük Hüseyin Pasha: Küçük Hüseyin Pasha (1757 – 7 December 1803), also known as Tayazade Damat Küçük Hüseyin Pasha, was an Ottoman statesman and admiral who was Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral of the Ottoman Navy) from 11 March 1792 to 7 December 1803.  He was a "damat" ("bridegroom") to the Ottoman dynasty after he married an Ottoman princess, Esma Sultan.
Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdul Hamid I): Esma Sultan (17 July 1778 – 4 June 1848) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid I, sister of Sultan Mustafa IV and Sultan Mahmud II.  She was the adoptive mother of Bezmiâlem Sultan and Rahime Perestu Sultan.
Sultan Ahmed Mosque: The Sultan Ahmed Mosque or Sultan Ahmet Mosque (Turkish: "Sultan Ahmet Camii" ) is a historic mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey.  A popular tourist site, the Sultan Ahmed Mosque continues to function as a mosque today; men still kneel in prayer on the mosque's lush red carpet after the call to prayer.  The Blue Mosque, as it is popularly known, was constructed between 1609 and 1616 during the rule of Ahmed I.  Its Külliye contains Ahmed's tomb, a madrasah and a hospice.  Hand-painted blue tiles adorn the mosque’s interior walls, and at night the mosque is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque’s five main domes, six minarets and eight secondary domes.  It sits next to the Hagia Sophia, another popular tourist site.
Laleli Mosque: The Laleli Mosque (Turkish: "Laleli Camii, or Tulip Mosque" ) is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.
Esma Sultan Mansion: The Esma Sultan Mansion (Turkish: "Esma Sultan Yalısı" ), a historical yalı (English: waterside mansion ) located at Bosphorus in Ortaköy neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey and named after its original owner Esma Sultan, is used today as a cultural center after being redeveloped.
Esma Sultan: Esma Sultan is the name of three daughters of three Ottoman Sultans:
Gevheri Kadın: Gevheri Kadın (8 July 1856 – 6 September 1884) was the fifth wife of 32nd Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz.  She was the mother of Şehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin and Esma Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.
Esma Sultan (daughter of Ahmed III): Esma Sultan (14 March 1726 – 13 August 1788) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Ahmed III and his consort Zeynep Kadın.  She was the half-s...

---- FINAL ANSWER ----
The Laleli Mosque is located in the Laleli neighborhood of Fatih, Istanbul, while the Esma Sultan Mansion is located in the Ortaköy neighborhood of Istanbul. Laleli and Ortaköy are distinct neighborhoods separated by the Bosphorus Strait. Therefore, they are not in the same neighborhood.

It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad " The Union Connecting".

The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.

AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad " The Union Connecting".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.

The question asks about the formation of the South Korean boy group behind the 2014 S/S album. According to the context, 2014 S/S is the debut album of WINNER, which was formed by YG Entertainment. A key check is to verify if YG Entertainment is indeed the label that formed WINNER, as the context explicitly states WINNER was formed by YG Entertainment and released their debut album under that label. Confirming this formation detail through official group biographies or YG Entertainment’s public records would validate the answer.

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: Are Local H and For Against both from the United States?

---- CONTEXT ----
Mendocino County GMO Ban: Mendocino County, California, was the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the cultivation, production or distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004.  Initiated by the group "GMO Free Mendocino", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.  Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of "GMO free zones."  Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states.
United States Senate election in Illinois, 1978: The 1978 United States Senate election in Illinois took place on November 7, 1978.  Incumbent Republican United States Senator Charles H. Percy ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate.  Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Alex Seith, an attorney who had been appointed to several local government positions.  Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive.  In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, "I got your message and you're right."  Percy's last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate.
William H. Cook Water Tank House: The William H. Cook Water Tank House is a water tank house located southeast of Jerome, Idaho, United States.  The building was constructed circa 1915 and was used to store water for William H. Cook's farm.  The rectangular building was constructed with lava rock and contains a metal tank.  Although the stone craftsmanship in the building is similar to the work of local stonemason H. T. Pugh, the builder of the house has not been determined.
Amherst, Massachusetts: Amherst ( ) is a town in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States, in the Connecticut River valley.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 37,819, making it the largest municipality in Hampshire County (although the county seat is Northampton).  The town is home to Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, three of the Five Colleges.  The name of the town is pronounced without the "h" ("AM-erst"), giving rise to the local saying, "only the 'h' is silent", in reference both to the pronunciation and to the town's politically active populace.
Local H: Local H is an American rock band originally formed by guitarist and vocalist Scott Lucas, bassist Matt Garcia, drummer Joe Daniels, and lead guitarist John Sparkman in Zion, Illinois in 1987.  The members all met in high school in 1987 and founded Local H three years later.

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: What is the name of the fight song of the university whose main campus is in Lawrence, Kansas and whose branch campuses are in the Kansas City metropolitan area?

---- CONTEXT ----
North Kansas City, Missouri: North Kansas City is a city in Clay County, Missouri, United States that despite the similarity in name to its larger counterpart, Kansas City, is an independent municipality part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.  The population was 4,208 at the 2010 census.  Originally a northern suburb across the Missouri River from Kansas City, Missouri, it is now almost completely surrounded by Kansas City, which has annexed far to the north of North Kansas City's northern city limits.  North Kansas City also adjoins the small municipality of Avondale.
University of Missouri–Kansas City: The University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC) is a public research university serving the greater Kansas City metropolitan area.  Located in Kansas City, Missouri, UMKC is one of four system campuses that collectively constitute the University of Missouri.  UMKC is spread across multiple locales; the main Volker Campus, home to the majority of university operations, is located in Kansas City's Rockhill neighborhood, east of the Country Club Plaza, and adjacent to both the Stowers Institute for Medical Research and the world-renowned Linda Hall Library.  In 2017 the University, in collaboration with Truman Medical Center, Children's Mercy Hospital, the Missouri Health Department, the Jackson County Medical Examiners Office, and the Missouri Department of Mental Health Behavioral Medicine, formed the UMKC Health Sciences District on Hospital Hill.  This district is a first-in-the-nation partnership between local and state governments, the university, and these nationally recognized healthcare faculties, designed to promote collaboration in research, innovation, education, grant funding, and community outreach, for the advancement of health and wellness in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area.  Also in 2017, the university announced plans to expand its metropolitan identity with the construction of a downtown Campus for the Arts, located near the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.  The university's enrollment as of 2015 exceeded more than 16,600 students.
Kansas City jazz: Kansas City jazz is a style of jazz that developed in Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri and the surrounding Kansas City Metropolitan Area during the 1930s and marked the transition from the structured big band style to the musical improvisation style of Bebop.  The hard-swinging, bluesy transition style is bracketed by Count Basie who in 1929 signed with the Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra and Kansas City native Charlie Parker who was to usher in the Bebop style in the 1940s.  According to a Kansas City website, "While New Orleans was the birthplace of jazz, America's music grew up in Kansas City".  Kansas City is known as one of the most popular "cradles of jazz".  Other cities include New Orleans, Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York City.
Kansas City Scout: Kansas City Scout is one of the United States' largest electronic traffic management systems.  It was created in 2000 as part of a bi-state initiative between the Missouri Department of Transportation and the Kansas Department of Transportation to provide this system for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, which is in both Missouri and Kansas (the anchor city of Kansas City is in Missouri).  The project's cost was $43 million.  Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.  KDOT and MoDOT shared the re...

---- FINAL ANSWER ----
The provided context does not explicitly state the name of the fight song for a university with its main campus in Lawrence, Kansas, and branch campuses in the Kansas City metropolitan area. While UMKC is mentioned as serving the Kansas City area, its main campus is in Kansas City, Missouri, not Lawrence, Kansas. The context references "The UMKC March" as the fight song, but this applies to a university not located in Lawrence. No reliable information is given about a university in Lawrence with branch campuses in Kansas City. Therefore, based solely on the upstream content, the fight song cannot be determined.

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: What screenwriter with credits for "Evolution" co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni?

---- CONTEXT ----
Ungod: Ungod is the debut album released in 1994 on Columbia Records by the American industrial rock band Stabbing Westward.  The album was recorded in six weeks of 1993 in Chiswick, England, and released on February 15, 1994.  With adequate album sales and touring with the likes of Depeche Mode a second album was warranted, "Wither Blister Burn & Peel".  The guitar line in the chorus of the song "Ungod" was later used in Filter's song "Hey Man, Nice Shot."

---- FINAL ANSWER ----
The screenwriter with credits for *Evolution* is David Weissman. He co-wrote *Deadfall* (1993), which stars Nicolas Cage, but there is no mention of Téa Leoni in that film or in any film co-written by Weissman that stars both Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. The only film featuring both Cage and Téa Leoni mentioned is *Season of the Witch* (2011), which was not co-written by Weissman. Therefore, based on the provided context, no such film exists with both actors and Weissman as a co-writer.

Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: What year did Guns N Roses perform a promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective?

---- CONTEXT ----
Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography: Arnold Schwarzenegger is an actor who has appeared in over 30 films, and has also ventured into directing and producing.  He began his acting career primarily with small roles in film and television.  For his first film role, he was credited as "Arnold Strong", but was credited with his birth name thereafter.  He has appeared mainly in action, and comedy films.  In addition to films and television, he has appeared in music videos for AC/DC, Bon Jovi, and Guns N' Roses.
Guns N' Roses discography: Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1985 by members of Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns.  The band has released six studio albums, two live albums, two compilation albums, two extended plays, seven video albums, eighteen singles, twenty four music videos and one video single.  Guns N' Roses signed a deal with Geffen Records in 1986, after the independently released EP "Live ?! *@ Like a Suicide" a year before.  Its debut studio album "Appetite for Destruction" was released in 1987, reached the top of the "Billboard" 200 and sold 18 million units in the United States and approximately 33 million units worldwide.
Hammerjack's: Hammerjacks Concert Hall and Nightclub was a large concert hall in downtown Baltimore through the 1980s and into the 1990s owned by Louis J. Principio III The club attracted many big-name national acts, but also showcased many rising stars in the music world.  The bands ranged from punk, glam, and heavy metal acts most commonly associated with the venue (e.g., Guns n Roses, Kix, Ratt, Skid Row or Extreme) to pop (e.g., Badfinger) and alternative rock groups (e.g., Goo Goo Dolls).  The club was often frequented by hard core patrons and musicians donning big hair, leather, lace, spandex, and heavy makeup, and was considered a "hard rock shrine."  Hamerjacks, however, attracted audiences with other attire as well.  It was torn down on June 12, 1997 to make way for M&T Bank Stadium parking lot.  Hammerjacks was billed as "The largest nightclub on the east coast."
Steven Adler: Steven Adler (born Michael Coletti; January 22, 1965) is an American musician.  He is best known as the former drummer and co-songwriter of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s.  Adler was fired from Guns N' Roses over his heroin addiction in 1990, following which he reformed his old band Road Crew and briefly joined BulletBoys, which both proved unsuccessful.  During the 2000s, Adler was the drummer of the band Adler's Appetite, and from 2012, he had held the same position in the band Adler.  In early 2017, Steven Adler declared that he has no intention to continue with the band, and that the band has now dissolved, and the reason is his lack of interest in performing during poorly attended concerts.  He appeared on the second and fifth seasons of the reality TV show "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew", as well as on the first season of its spin-off "Sober House".  He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Guns N' Roses.

MODEL OUTPUT:
The question references a promotional event by Guns N' Roses for a film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. However, no such film exists in Schwarzenegger’s filmography with that plot detail. The only film in which Schwarzenegger played a police detective is *The Terminator* (1984), *Total Recall* (1990), and *Predator* (1987), none of which feature a former New York Police detective. Additionally, Guns N' Roses has no documented promo ties to any of Schwarzenegger’s films. External verification is needed to confirm if a promotional event occurred, or if the premise is based on a misremembered or fictional detail.

The context mentions that Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared in music videos for Guns N' Roses, but it does not specify a promo for a movie starring him as a former New York Police detective. The film in question is likely *The Terminator* (1984), where Schwarzenegger played a cyborg, or *Total Recall* (1990), but neither features him as a police detective. There is no direct reference in the provided context linking a Guns N' Roses promo to a Schwarzenegger movie with that plot. Therefore, the specific year cannot be determined from the given information. Check if any music video collaborations between Guns N' Roses and Schwarzenegger are documented in external sources.

The film was made at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome.  The film is also known by the alternative title The Life of Giuseppe Verdi.
Parma Airport: Parma Airport (Italian: "Aeroporto di Parma" , IATA: PMF, ICAO: LIMP ) is located 1.3 NM northwest of Parma, a city in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.  The airport was opened on 5 May 1991.  It is also known as Giuseppe Verdi Airport or Parma "Giuseppe Verdi" Airport, named after Giuseppe Verdi.

He created roles in three major premieres at the Paris Opera – Don Diego in "L'Africaine" by Meyerbeer (1865), the Monk in Verdi's "Don Carlos" (1867), and Horatio in Ambroise Thomas's "Hamlet" (1868).  Castelmary also appeared at opera houses in England and the United States, and died onstage at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, during a performance of "Martha" by Friedrich von Flotow.

---- FINAL ANSWER ----
Both Giuseppe Verdi and Ambroise Thomas are confirmed opera composers based on the provided context. Verdi is explicitly described as an Italian opera composer, and Thomas is identified as a French composer best known for his operas "Mignon" and "Hamlet."

MODEL OUTPUT:
The Force India driver born in 1990 is Sergio Pérez. The context mentions that Pérez is Mexican and currently drives for Force India. To answer the question about another Mexican Formula One driver who has held the podium, we must identify if any other Mexican driver has achieved a podium finish in F1. The provided context does not list any other Mexican F1 driver with a podium finish. Therefore, based on the given information, no other Mexican Formula One driver besides Sergio Pérez is mentioned as having held the podium. Further verification of Mexican F1 drivers' podium records is needed.

Therefore, based on the given information, no other Mexican Formula One driver besides Sergio Pérez is mentioned as having held the podium. Further verification of Mexican F1 drivers' podium records is needed.

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: This singer of A Rather Blustery Day also voiced what hedgehog?

---- CONTEXT ----
Hip Hip Pooh-Ray!: "Hip Hip Pooh-Ray!"  is a song from the 1968 musical film featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".  It is sung by the cast as a release from the dramatic tension of the story.  The song is also incorporated into (and used as the promotional tagline for) the 1977 musical film "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" which is an amalgamation of three Winnie-the-Pooh featurettes including "Blustery Day".  In the song, Pooh and Piglet are hailed as heroes (Pooh for saving Piglet's life, and Piglet for giving Owl his grand home in the beech tree).
Heffalumps and Woozles: "Heffalumps and Woozles" is a song from the 1968 Walt Disney musical film featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".  It was written by the Sherman Brothers, and performed by The Mellomen.  It is also in the 1977 full-length feature film "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh".
The House That Jack Built (1967 film): The House That Jack Built is a 1967 National Film Board of Canada animated short based on the nursery rhyme "This Is the House That Jack Built."  Directed by Ron Tunis, written by and produced by Wolf Koenig, the eight-minute film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, losing to "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" at the 41st Academy Awards.  Jack is desperate to escape his nine-to-five life.  Mirroring the fairy tale, he trades his car for a handful of beans.
Kate Higgins: Catherine Davis "Kate" Higgins (born August 16, 1969 in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.), also known as Kate Davis, is an American voice actress, singer and jazz pianist.  Her major voice roles have been in English-language adaptations of Japanese anime, and is best known as the voice of Sakura Haruno in "Naruto".  She has also voiced C.C. in "Code Geass" and Saber in the original "Fate/stay Night".  In 2010, she voiced Miles "Tails" Prower in the video game series "Sonic the Hedgehog".  She also voices Kate, Stinky and Lilly in the "Alpha and Omega" sequels.  In 2014, She became the voice of Ami Mizuno / Sailor Mercury in the Viz English dub of "Sailor Moon".
The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers: "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" is the theme song and personal anthem of Tigger, a fictional tiger from the children's book series Winnie-the-Pooh.  Although Tigger's birthday is believed to be in October 1928, the year that "The House at Pooh Corner" was first published, on Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger's birth year as 1968, a reference to the first year that Tigger appeared in a Disney production, "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".  That was also the same instance when Tigger first sang this song.  The song is repeated in Disney's 1974 release "Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! ", The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh".  "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" opens up the 2000 release of "The Tigger Movie".  In 1974, Paul Winchell earned a Grammy for his rendition of the song.
Jim Cummings: James Jonah Cummings (born November 3, 1952) is an American voice actor and singer, who has appeared in almost 400 roles.  He is known for voicing the title character from "Darkwing Duck", Dr. Robotnik from "Sonic the Hedgehog", and Pete.  His other characters include Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, and the Tasmanian Devil.  He has performed in numerous Disney and DreamWorks animations including "Aladdin", "The Lion King", "Balto", "Antz", "T...

---- FINAL ANSWER ----
The provided context does not explicitly state that Jim Cummings, the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day," voiced a hedgehog. While Cummings is known for voicing Dr. Robotnik in the *Sonic the Hedgehog* franchise, Dr. Robotnik is a robotic antagonist and not a hedgehog. Tails (Miles Prower), a hedgehog character, was voiced by Kate Higgins, not Jim Cummings. Therefore, based on the upstream content, no hedgehog was voiced by the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day."

MODEL OUTPUT:
The singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" is Jim Cummings, who voiced Winnie the Pooh and Tigger in the film. He is also known for voicing Dr. Robotnik (Sonic the Hedgehog) and the Tasmanian Devil. The question asks which hedgehog he voiced—this is likely referring to Tails (Miles Prower), but Cummings did not voice Tails. Instead, Kate Higgins voiced Tails in 2010. Therefore, Jim Cummings did not voice a hedgehog in the Sonic series. Confirm if the "singer" refers to a performer of the song or a voice actor of the characters. Check whether "A Rather Blustery Day" is linked to a specific performer or if it's a misattribution.

That was also the same instance when Tigger first sang this song.  The song is repeated in Disney's 1974 release "Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! ", The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh".  "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" opens up the 2000 release of "The Tigger Movie".  In 1974, Paul Winchell earned a Grammy for his rendition of the song.
Jim Cummings: James Jonah Cummings (born November 3, 1952) is an American voice actor and singer, who has appeared in almost 400 roles.  He is known for voicing the title character from "Darkwing Duck", Dr. Robotnik from "Sonic the Hedgehog", and Pete.  His other characters include Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, and the Tasmanian Devil.

        Note from peer2:
        The singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" is Jim Cummings, who voiced Winnie the Pooh and Tigger in the film. He is also known for voicing Dr. Robotnik (Sonic the Hedgehog) and the Tasmanian Devil. The question asks which hedgehog he voiced—this is likely referring to Tails (Miles Prower), but Cummings did not voice Tails. Instead, Kate Higgins voiced Tails in 2010. Therefore, Jim Cummings did not voice a hedgehog in the Sonic series. Confirm if the "singer" refers to a performer of the song or a voice actor of the characters. Check whether "A Rather Blustery Day" is linked to a specific performer or if it's a misattribution.

MODEL OUTPUT:
The song "A Rather Blustery Day" is performed in the 1968 film featurette and features Jim Cummings as a voice actor, notably voicing Winnie the Pooh and Tigger. However, the "singer" of the song is not explicitly stated in the context—Jim Cummings is listed as a voice actor, not necessarily the performer of the song. The hedgehog character in question (Tails/Miles Prower) was voiced by Kate Higgins in 2010, not Jim Cummings. Confirm whether "singer" refers to the performer of the song or the voice actor of the characters. If the former, the song's performer is not clearly identified in the provided context.

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: Aside from the Apple Remote, what other device can control the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with?

---- CONTEXT ----
Universal remote: A universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices.  Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions.
Remote control: In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.  In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.
Apple Remote: The Apple Remote is a remote control device released in or after October 2005 by Apple Inc. for use with a number of its products which use infrared capabilities.  The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.  The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.  It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation.  Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive.
Siri Remote: The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV.  The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote.  It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K.
NetSupport Manager: NetSupport Manager is a Windows-centric cross-platform remote control software, allowing remote screen control and systems management from a Windows or Windows Mobile device of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris and Mobile devices.  It was first released for DOS only networks in 1989.  It supports thumbnail display of unlimited remote systems (since version 10), and allows navigation between remote systems in a manner similar to a KVM switch.  Functionality includes file transfers, chat, and hardware/software inventory including software updates. Fewer features are supported for Linux and Mac clients.  In 2012 NetSupport introduced new software versions allowing Remote Control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones as well as a new Mac OS Control.  Version 12 was released in October 2013, which extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients.  Mobile Remote Control from iOS and Android was also extended with additional capabilities.

---- FINAL ANSWER ----
The Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with Front Row on the iSight iMac G5 and early Apple TV models. Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple used nameless infrared (IR) remotes for devices like the Macintosh TV and PowerCD drive, which indicates that IR remotes were the primary control method for Apple's ecosystem. While no specific third-party device is explicitly named as an alternative to the Apple Remote for controlling Front Row, the context suggests that IR remotes, such as those used for the Macintosh TV and PowerCD drive, were capable of controlling similar Apple programs. Therefore, based on the available information, the only other device type originally designed to control such programs was Apple's own nameless IR remotes.

Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions.
Remote control: In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.  In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.
Apple Remote: The Apple Remote is a remote control device released in or after October 2005 by Apple Inc. for use with a number of its products which use infrared capabilities.  The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.  The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.  It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation.  Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive.
Siri Remote: The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV.  The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote.  It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K.
NetSupport Manager: NetSupport Manager is a Windows-centric cross-platform remote control software, allowing remote screen control and systems management from a Windows or Windows Mobile device of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris and Mobile devices.  It was first released for DOS only networks in 1989.  It supports thumbnail display of unlimited remote systems (since version 10), and allows navigation between remote systems in a manner similar to a KVM switch.  Functionality includes file transfers, chat, and hardware/software inventory including software updates. Fewer features are supported for Linux and Mac clients.  In 2012 NetSupport introduced new software versions allowing Remote Control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones as well as a new Mac OS Control.  Version 12 was released in October 2013, which extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients.  Mobile Remote Control from iOS and Android was also extended with additional capabilities.  All versions of NetSupport Manager re...

The Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with Front Row on the iSight iMac G5. It was later used with early generations of Apple TV as the primary control device. While the context confirms the Apple Remote’s original target programs, it does not specify alternative devices capable of controlling Front Row or other programs it was designed for. Peer1 should verify whether any third-party remotes or hardware were officially compatible with Front Row before concluding no relevant information exists. Check if any Apple documentation or product release notes from 2005–2010 mention alternative control methods for Front Row.

The Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with Front Row on the iSight iMac G5 and later with early generations of Apple TV. While it was not designed for general consumer electronics, it functioned as a remote control for Apple's own devices, specifically those using infrared (IR) capabilities. Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple used nameless IR remotes for devices like the Macintosh TV and PowerCD drive, indicating that IR remotes were the primary control method for Apple hardware. Universal remotes can control multiple devices, but the Apple Remote was specifically tailored for Apple's ecosystem. Thus, the only other device it was originally designed to interact with was Apple's Front Row media program and early Apple TV models.

The Apple Remote was originally designed to control Apple's Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and early generations of Apple TV. These devices used infrared (IR) technology, aligning with Apple's internal ecosystem. While universal remotes can control multiple brands, the Apple Remote was not intended for general consumer electronics but specifically for Apple's own hardware. Prior Apple IR remotes were used for devices like the Macintosh TV and PowerCD drive, indicating a consistent use of IR for Apple products. The key point is that the Apple Remote's original design was ecosystem-specific, not cross-brand.

The first EP and several singles were released on Gough's own label "Twisted Nerve", which he started with like-minded Manchester musician Andy Votel.  Badly Drawn Boy rose in popularity in 1997 when he joined the likes of Thom Yorke, Richard Ashcroft, and Mike D on the celebrity-filled UNKLE album "Psyence Fiction".  Due to the mild UK chart success of the 1999 single "Once Around the Block", XL Recordings signed up Badly Drawn Boy to release the debut album "The Hour of Bewilderbeast" in 2000.  The album won critical praise and Britain's acclaimed Mercury Prize for Best Album.  The album caught the attention of author Nick Hornby who then asked Gough to score the film being made for his book "About a Boy".

It is an adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby.  The film stars are Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, and Rachel Weisz.  The film at times uses double voice-over narration, when the audience hears both Will's and Marcus's thoughts.
Silent Sigh: "Silent Sigh" is a single by British musical artist Badly Drawn Boy from the soundtrack to the film "About a Boy".  It reached number 16 in the UK Singles Chart.

        Badly Drawn Boy is described as a multi-instrumentalist who wrote, produced, and played several instruments on his debut album *The Hour of Bewilderbeast*, indicating a high instrument-to-person ratio within his solo work. Wolf Alice is a four-piece band with clearly defined roles: Ellie Rowsell (vocals, guitar), Joff Oddie (guitars, vocals), Theo Ellis (bass), and Joel Amey (drums, vocals)—suggesting a more distributed instrument-to-person ratio. No explicit data is provided on instrument counts per member for either act, so we cannot directly compare ratios. Need to verify if any context specifies instrument usage or performance details beyond solo work or standard band lineups.

While Wolf Alice is described as a four-piece band with defined roles, and Badly Drawn Boy is noted as a multi-instrumentalist who wrote, produced, and played instruments on albums, no data is provided on instrument-to-person ratios during performances. To answer the question, we need explicit information on instruments per performer in live or recorded performances.
