New York Society of Model Engineers: The New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City.  There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad " The Union Connecting".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.

Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the...

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: Are Local H and For Against both from the United States?

---- CONTEXT ----
Mendocino County GMO Ban: Mendocino County, California, was the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the cultivation, production or distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004.  Initiated by the group "GMO Free Mendocino", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.  Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of "GMO free zones."  Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states.
United States Senate election in Illinois, 1978: The 1978 United States Senate election in Illinois took place on November 7, 1978.  Incumbent Republican United States Senator Charles H. Percy ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate.  Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Alex Seith, an attorney who had been appointed to several local government positions.  Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive.  In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, "I got your message and you're right."  Percy's last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate.
William H. Cook Water Tank House: The William H. Cook Water Tank House is a water tank house located southeast of Jerome, Idaho, United States.  The building was constructed circa 1915 and was used to store water for William H. Cook's farm.  The rectangular building was constructed with lava rock and contains a metal tank.  Although the stone craftsmanship in the building is similar to the work of local stonemason H. T. Pugh, the builder of the house has not been determined.
Amherst, Massachusetts: Amherst ( ) is a town in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States, in the Connecticut River valley.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 37,819, making it the largest municipality in Hampshire County (although the county seat is Northampton).

        Mendocino County GMO Ban: Mendocino County, California, was the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the cultivation, production or distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004.  Initiated by the group "GMO Free Mendocino", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.  Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of "GMO free zones."  Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states.
United States Senate election in Illinois, 1978: The 1978 United States Senate election in Illinois took place on November 7, 1978.  Incumbent Republican United States Senator Charles H. Percy ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate.  Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Alex Seith, an attorney who had been appointed to several local government positions.  Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive.  In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, "I got your message and you're right."  Percy's last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate.
William H. Cook Water Tank House: The William H. Cook Water Tank House is a water tank house located southeast of Jerome, Idaho, United States.

North Kansas City, Missouri: North Kansas City is a city in Clay County, Missouri, United States that despite the similarity in name to its larger counterpart, Kansas City, is an independent municipality part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.  The population was 4,208 at the 2010 census.  Originally a northern suburb across the Missouri River from Kansas City, Missouri, it is now almost completely surrounded by Kansas City, which has annexed far to the north of North Kansas City's northern city limits.

In 2017 the University, in collaboration with Truman Medical Center, Children's Mercy Hospital, the Missouri Health Department, the Jackson County Medical Examiners Office, and the Missouri Department of Mental Health Behavioral Medicine, formed the UMKC Health Sciences District on Hospital Hill.  This district is a first-in-the-nation partnership between local and state governments, the university, and these nationally recognized healthcare faculties, designed to promote collaboration in research, innovation, education, grant funding, and community outreach, for the advancement of health and wellness in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area.  Also in 2017, the university announced plans to expand its metropolitan identity with the construction of a downtown Campus for the Arts, located near the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.

According to a Kansas City website, "While New Orleans was the birthplace of jazz, America's music grew up in Kansas City".  Kansas City is known as one of the most popular "cradles of jazz".

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: What screenwriter with credits for "Evolution" co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni?

---- CONTEXT ----
Ungod: Ungod is the debut album released in 1994 on Columbia Records by the American industrial rock band Stabbing Westward.  The album was recorded in six weeks of 1993 in Chiswick, England, and released on February 15, 1994.  With adequate album sales and touring with the likes of Depeche Mode a second album was warranted, "Wither Blister Burn & Peel".  The guitar line in the chorus of the song "Ungod" was later used in Filter's song "Hey Man, Nice Shot."  Stuart Zechman, who was also playing guitar for Filter at the time, took the riff and showed it to Stabbing Westward who ended up using it as well.  The song "Nothing" appeared in the "Bad Boys" movie starring Will Smith, Martin Lawrence and Téa Leoni, but was not featured on the official soundtrack album.  The song also accompanied the credits of the film "Johnny Mnemonic" and was included on the film's soundtrack, along with the song "Lost".  "Lost", "Lies" and "Can't Happen Here" were used in the film "Mortal Kombat", but Stabbing Westward refused to include it in the official soundtrack.  The "Thread Mix" of "Violent Mood Swings" was included in the Clerks soundtrack.
Season of the Witch (2011 film): Season of the Witch is a 2011 American historical fantasy adventure film starring Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman and directed by Dominic Sena with extensive uncredited reshoots by Brett Ratner.  Cage and Perlman star as Teutonic Knights, who return from the Crusades to find their fatherland ruined by the Black Death.  Two church elders accuse a girl (Claire Foy) of being a witch responsible for the destruction; they command the two knights to transport the girl to a monastery so the monks can lift her curse from the land.  The film draws inspiration from the 1957 film "The Seventh Seal".  It reunited Sena and Cage who had previously worked together on "Gone in 60 Seconds".
Time to Kill (1989 film): Time to Kill (Italian: Tempo di uccidere ) is a 1989 Italian drama film starring Nicolas Cage and Italian actors Ricky Tognazzi and Giancarlo Giannini .  It is directed by Giuliano Montaldo.  The film is set in 1936, when Ethiopia was an Italian colony, and was filmed in Zimbabwe.  It is based on the novel with the same name written by Ennio Flaiano.
David Weissman: David Weissman is a screenwriter and director.  His film credits include "The Family Man" (2000), "Evolution" (2001), and ""When in Rome"" (2010).
Deadfall (1993 film): Deadfall is a 1993 crime drama film directed by Christopher Coppola.  Coppola co-wrote the script with Nick Vallelonga.  The film stars Michael Biehn, Nicolas Cage, Charlie Sheen, James Coburn, and Peter Fonda.  It is also the prime influence on the song 'Deadfall', written by the American hardcore punk band Snot.  A prequel/sequel, "Arsenal", starring Nicolas Cage as his character Eddie King, was released in 2017.
Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film): Gone in 60 Seconds is a 2000 American action heist film, starring Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Eccleston, Robert Duvall, Vinnie Jones, and Will Patton.  The film was directed by Dominic Sena, written by Scott Rosenberg, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of "The Rock" and "Con Air" (both of which starred Cage) and "Armageddon" (which starred Patton), and is a loose remake of the 1974 H.B.

Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: What year did Guns N Roses perform a promo for a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective?

---- CONTEXT ----
Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography: Arnold Schwarzenegger is an actor who has appeared in over 30 films, and has also ventured into directing and producing.  He began his acting career primarily with small roles in film and television.  For his first film role, he was credited as "Arnold Strong", but was credited with his birth name thereafter.  He has appeared mainly in action, and comedy films.  In addition to films and television, he has appeared in music videos for AC/DC, Bon Jovi, and Guns N' Roses.
Guns N' Roses discography: Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1985 by members of Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns.  The band has released six studio albums, two live albums, two compilation albums, two extended plays, seven video albums, eighteen singles, twenty four music videos and one video single.  Guns N' Roses signed a deal with Geffen Records in 1986, after the independently released EP "Live ?! *@ Like a Suicide" a year before.  Its debut studio album "Appetite for Destruction" was released in 1987, reached the top of the "Billboard" 200 and sold 18 million units in the United States and approximately 33 million units worldwide.
Hammerjack's: Hammerjacks Concert Hall and Nightclub was a large concert hall in downtown Baltimore through the 1980s and into the 1990s owned by Louis J. Principio III The club attracted many big-name national acts, but also showcased many rising stars in the music world.  The bands ranged from punk, glam, and heavy metal acts most commonly associated with the venue (e.g., Guns n Roses, Kix, Ratt, Skid Row or Extreme) to pop (e.g., Badfinger) and alternative rock groups (e.g., Goo Goo Dolls).  The club was often frequented by hard core patrons and musicians donning big hair, leather, lace, spandex, and heavy makeup, and was considered a "hard rock shrine."  Hamerjacks, however, attracted audiences with other attire as well.  It was torn down on June 12, 1997 to make way for M&T Bank Stadium parking lot.  Hammerjacks was billed as "The largest nightclub on the east coast."
Steven Adler: Steven Adler (born Michael Coletti; January 22, 1965) is an American musician.  He is best known as the former drummer and co-songwriter of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s.  Adler was fired from Guns N' Roses over his heroin addiction in 1990, following which he reformed his old band Road Crew and briefly joined BulletBoys, which both proved unsuccessful.  During the 2000s, Adler was the drummer of the band Adler's Appetite, and from 2012, he had held the same position in the band Adler.  In early 2017, Steven Adler declared that he has no intention to continue with the band, and that the band has now dissolved, and the reason is his lack of interest in performing during poorly attended concerts.  He appeared on the second and fifth seasons of the reality TV show "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew", as well as on the first season of its spin-off "Sober House".  He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Guns N' Roses.

        Shared context you can reference:
        Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography: Arnold Schwarzenegger is an actor who has appeared in over 30 films, and has also ventured into directing and producing.  He began his acting career primarily with small roles in film and television.  For his first film role, he was credited as "Arnold Strong", but was credited with his birth name thereafter.  He has appeared mainly in action, and comedy films.  In addition to films and television, he has appeared in music videos for AC/DC, Bon Jovi, and Guns N' Roses.
Guns N' Roses discography: Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1985 by members of Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns.  The band has released six studio albums, two live albums, two compilation albums, two extended plays, seven video albums, eighteen singles, twenty four music videos and one video single.  Guns N' Roses signed a deal with Geffen Records in 1986, after the independently released EP "Live ?! *@ Like a Suicide" a year before.  Its debut studio album "Appetite for Destruction" was released in 1987, reached the top of the "Billboard" 200 and sold 18 million units in the United States and approximately 33 million units worldwide.
Hammerjack's: Hammerjacks Concert Hall and Nightclub was a large concert hall in downtown Baltimore through the 1980s and into the 1990s owned by Louis J. Principio III The club attracted many big-name national acts, but also showcased many rising stars in the music world.  The bands ranged from punk, glam, and heavy metal acts most commonly associated with the venue (e.g., Guns n Roses, Kix, Ratt, Skid Row or Extreme) to pop (e.g., Badfinger) and alternative rock groups (e.g., Goo Goo Dolls).  The club was often frequented by hard core patrons and musicians donning big hair, leather, lace, spandex, and heavy makeup, and was considered a "hard rock shrine."  Hamerjacks, however, attracted audiences with other attire as well.  It was torn down on June 12, 1997 to make way for M&T Bank Stadium parking lot.  Hammerjacks was billed as "The largest nightclub on the east coast."
Steven Adler: Steven Adler (born Michael Coletti; January 22, 1965) is an American musician.  He is best known as the former drummer and co-songwriter of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s.  Adler was fired from Guns N' Roses over his heroin addiction in 1990, following which he reformed his old band Road Crew and briefly joined BulletBoys, which both proved unsuccessful.  During the 2000s, Adler was the drummer of the band Adler's Appetite, and from 2012, he had held the same position in the band Adler.  In early 2017, Steven Adler declared that he has no intention to continue with the band, and that the band has now dissolved, and the reason is his lack of interest in performing during poorly attended concerts.  He appeared on the second and fifth seasons of the reality TV show "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew", as well as on the first season of its spin-off "Sober House".  He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Guns N' Roses.

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: The football manager who recruited David Beckham managed Manchester United during what timeframe?

---- CONTEXT ----
Joshua Parlby: Joshua Parlby (born 1855 in Longton, Staffordshire) was an English football manager who managed Manchester City in the 1890s.
1996 FA Charity Shield: The 1996 FA Charity Shield (also known as the Littlewoods FA Charity Shield for sponsorship reasons) was the 74th FA Charity Shield, an annual football match played between the winners of the previous season's Premier League and FA Cup competitions.  The match was played on 11 August 1996 at Wembley Stadium and contested by Manchester United, who had won the Double of Premier League and FA Cup in 1995–96, and Newcastle United, who had finished as runners-up in the Premier League.  Manchester United won the match 4–0 with goals from Eric Cantona, Nicky Butt, David Beckham and Roy Keane.
Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex: The Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex is a public leisure centre located in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, Scotland.  It is named in honour of Sir Matt Busby, the football manager who was born in Bellshill in 1909, managed Manchester United from 1945 to 1969 and died in 1994.
Ernest Mangnall: James Ernest Mangnall (4 January 1866 – 13 January 1932) was an English football manager who started his career with Burnley and managed Manchester United between 1903–1912 and then went on to manage Manchester City from 1912–1924, and is the only man to date to have managed both clubs.
David Beckham Academy: The David Beckham Academy was a football school founded by England international David Beckham in 2005.  In 2009 it operated in two locations: in London, United Kingdom, and in Los Angeles, California, United States.  The academy pulled out of the London site at the end of the lease in October 2009, and the California branch closed soon after.
1995–96 Manchester United F.C. season: The 1995–96 season was Manchester United's fourth season in the Premier League, and their 21st consecutive season in the top division of English football.  United finished the season by becoming the first English team to win the Double (league title and FA Cup) twice.  Their triumph was made all the more remarkable by the fact that Alex Ferguson had sold experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis before the start of the season, and not made any major signings.  Instead, he had drafted in young players like Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers, Gary and Phil.
The Class of '92: The Class of '92 is a 2013 British documentary film, released on 1 December 2013.  The film centres on the rise of six young Manchester United footballers – David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Paul Scholes – and details their careers for Manchester United starting in 1992.
David Beckham's Soccer USA: David Beckham's Soccer USA was a football highlights and general discussion show presented by Tim Lovejoy and produced and broadcast in the United Kingdom by Five.  The show began following David Beckham's move to Los Angeles Galaxy, and Beckham often contributes to the show in the form of Interviews. Each week there was a special guest in the studio, usually a British sports personality, to whom Lovejoy chatted about their career and their views on Major League Soccer.  A slightly different version of the show hosted by Natalie Pinkham and completely devoid of any content derived from British studio footage was broadcast in the USA on Fox Soccer Channel.

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: This singer of A Rather Blustery Day also voiced what hedgehog?

---- CONTEXT ----
Hip Hip Pooh-Ray!: "Hip Hip Pooh-Ray!"  is a song from the 1968 musical film featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".  It is sung by the cast as a release from the dramatic tension of the story.  The song is also incorporated into (and used as the promotional tagline for) the 1977 musical film "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" which is an amalgamation of three Winnie-the-Pooh featurettes including "Blustery Day".  In the song, Pooh and Piglet are hailed as heroes (Pooh for saving Piglet's life, and Piglet for giving Owl his grand home in the beech tree).
Heffalumps and Woozles: "Heffalumps and Woozles" is a song from the 1968 Walt Disney musical film featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".  It was written by the Sherman Brothers, and performed by The Mellomen.  It is also in the 1977 full-length feature film "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh".
The House That Jack Built (1967 film): The House That Jack Built is a 1967 National Film Board of Canada animated short based on the nursery rhyme "This Is the House That Jack Built."  Directed by Ron Tunis, written by and produced by Wolf Koenig, the eight-minute film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, losing to "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" at the 41st Academy Awards.  Jack is desperate to escape his nine-to-five life.  Mirroring the fairy tale, he trades his car for a handful of beans.
Kate Higgins: Catherine Davis "Kate" Higgins (born August 16, 1969 in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.), also known as Kate Davis, is an American voice actress, singer and jazz pianist.  Her major voice roles have been in English-language adaptations of Japanese anime, and is best known as the voice of Sakura Haruno in "Naruto".  She has also voiced C.C. in "Code Geass" and Saber in the original "Fate/stay Night".  In 2010, she voiced Miles "Tails" Prower in the video game series "Sonic the Hedgehog".  She also voices Kate, Stinky and Lilly in the "Alpha and Omega" sequels.  In 2014, She became the voice of Ami Mizuno / Sailor Mercury in the Viz English dub of "Sailor Moon".
The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers: "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" is the theme song and personal anthem of Tigger, a fictional tiger from the children's book series Winnie-the-Pooh.  Although Tigger's birthday is believed to be in October 1928, the year that "The House at Pooh Corner" was first published, on Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger's birth year as 1968, a reference to the first year that Tigger appeared in a Disney production, "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".  That was also the same instance when Tigger first sang this song.  The song is repeated in Disney's 1974 release "Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! ", The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh".  "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" opens up the 2000 release of "The Tigger Movie".  In 1974, Paul Winchell earned a Grammy for his rendition of the song.
Jim Cummings: James Jonah Cummings (born November 3, 1952) is an American voice actor and singer, who has appeared in almost 400 roles.  He is known for voicing the title character from "Darkwing Duck", Dr. Robotnik from "Sonic the Hedgehog", and Pete.  His other characters include Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, and the Tasmanian Devil.

        Hip Hip Pooh-Ray!: "Hip Hip Pooh-Ray!"  is a song from the 1968 musical film featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".  It is sung by the cast as a release from the dramatic tension of the story.  The song is also incorporated into (and used as the promotional tagline for) the 1977 musical film "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" which is an amalgamation of three Winnie-the-Pooh featurettes including "Blustery Day".  In the song, Pooh and Piglet are hailed as heroes (Pooh for saving Piglet's life, and Piglet for giving Owl his grand home in the beech tree).
Heffalumps and Woozles: "Heffalumps and Woozles" is a song from the 1968 Walt Disney musical film featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".  It was written by the Sherman Brothers, and performed by The Mellomen.  It is also in the 1977 full-length feature film "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh".
The House That Jack Built (1967 film): The House That Jack Built is a 1967 National Film Board of Canada animated short based on the nursery rhyme "This Is the House That Jack Built."  Directed by Ron Tunis, written by and produced by Wolf Koenig, the eight-minute film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, losing to "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" at the 41st Academy Awards.  Jack is desperate to escape his nine-to-five life.  Mirroring the fairy tale, he trades his car for a handful of beans.
Kate Higgins: Catherine Davis "Kate" Higgins (born August 16, 1969 in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.), also known as Kate Davis, is an American voice actress, singer and jazz pianist.

The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers: "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" is the theme song and personal anthem of Tigger, a fictional tiger from the children's book series Winnie-the-Pooh.  Although Tigger's birthday is believed to be in October 1928, the year that "The House at Pooh Corner" was first published, on Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger's birth year as 1968, a reference to the first year that Tigger appeared in a Disney production, "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".  That was also the same instance when Tigger first sang this song.  The song is repeated in Disney's 1974 release "Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! ", The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh".  "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" opens up the 2000 release of "The Tigger Movie".  In 1974, Paul Winchell earned a Grammy for his rendition of the song.
Jim Cummings: James Jonah Cummings (born November 3, 1952) is an American voice actor and singer, who has appeared in almost 400 roles.

---- QUESTION ----
Answer the QA question using the provided context. Question: Aside from the Apple Remote, what other device can control the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with?

---- CONTEXT ----
Universal remote: A universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices.  Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions.
Remote control: In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.  In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.
Apple Remote: The Apple Remote is a remote control device released in or after October 2005 by Apple Inc. for use with a number of its products which use infrared capabilities.  The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.  The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.  It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation.  Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive.
Siri Remote: The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV.  The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote.  It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K.
NetSupport Manager: NetSupport Manager is a Windows-centric cross-platform remote control software, allowing remote screen control and systems management from a Windows or Windows Mobile device of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris and Mobile devices.  It was first released for DOS only networks in 1989.  It supports thumbnail display of unlimited remote systems (since version 10), and allows navigation between remote systems in a manner similar to a KVM switch.  Functionality includes file transfers, chat, and hardware/software inventory including software updates. Fewer features are supported for Linux and Mac clients.  In 2012 NetSupport introduced new software versions allowing Remote Control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones as well as a new Mac OS Control.  Version 12 was released in October 2013, which extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients.  Mobile Remote Control from iOS and Android was also extended with additional capabilities.

---- FINAL ANSWER ----
Aside from the Apple Remote, the Siri Remote is another device that can control the Apple TV, which originally used the Apple Remote. Additionally, universal remotes can be programmed to control devices that the Apple Remote interacts with, as they are designed to operate multiple brands and types of consumer electronics. It is important to verify the compatibility of these alternatives with the intended applications.

---- FINAL ANSWER ----
To determine which performance act has a higher instrument-to-person ratio, it is essential to know the specific number of instruments played by Badly Drawn Boy during his performances, as he is a solo artist who plays multiple instruments.
